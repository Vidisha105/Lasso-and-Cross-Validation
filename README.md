# Lasso-and-Cross-Validation

## Lasso Regression

Lasso Regression is a statistical technique which introduces penality to make it costly to take variables in the model. The lasso procedure encourages simple, parsimonious model on the basis of hyperparameter lambda. It minimizes the sensitivity of the model using regularization that if fluctuation of betas in case of addition of more variables into the model. It also enhances the prediction accuracy. 

## Cross Validation

Cross-validation is a resampling method that uses different portions of the data to test and train a model on different iterations.

## AIC, BIC and AICc

AIC and Cross Validation both are used to measure Out of Sample deviance. AIC measures the log-likelihood of the entire sample at once, based on parameters estimated using the entire sample, and subsequently adjusts for overfitting.  
BIC tries to find the TRUE model among the set of candidates.
